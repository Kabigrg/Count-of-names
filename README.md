# Count of names
Project Description

The program in main.py contains a variable (of type list) called list_of_names that has a list of 500 names.

The given program prints a count of names from the list that meets both these conditions: (a) has the letter 'H' in it, and (b) has more than 6 characters.

Modify the program such that it prints the following number:

A+B

Where:

A = count of names, from the given list, that has at least one of the letters from your unique 7 letter word.

B = count of names, from the given list, where the name's last letter is one of the letters of your unique 7 letter word.

Please keep in mind, your program should print a single numeric value

To get the maximum score, do not print any other extra output

HINT: In Python, the statement: 'X' in 'EXAM' returnsTrue because the string 'X' is contained inside of the string 'EXAM'.

HINT: A string can be indexed just like a list. Thus, if my_cats_name = 'JIMMY', then my_cats_name[-1] will return the last letter ('Y')
